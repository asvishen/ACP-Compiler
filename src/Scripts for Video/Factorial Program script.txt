This is a simple example program to find factorial of any number. Here, we have a function which is calling itself recursively to calculate the 
factorial of the number being passed to it.

When the function "fact" finishes, value is passed back to the calling variable. 

Then, an "IF" condition is used to determine whether the correct value is obtained or not.
