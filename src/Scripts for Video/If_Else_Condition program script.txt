This is a simple example program to demonstrate the IF_ELSE statement.

We're checking 2 conditions in the IF statement separated by the AND operator.

We have used "less-than-equals" and "equals" operators in this example.

If both conditions are satisfied, program will print "Both conditions satisfied"

Else it will print "Not satisfied"
